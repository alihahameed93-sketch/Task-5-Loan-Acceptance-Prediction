# Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction

## 📌 Objective
This repository contains the solution for Task 5 of the Data Science & Analytics internship at DevelopersHub Corporation.  
The goal is to build a classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to accept a personal loan or term deposit offer using the Bank Marketing dataset.

## 🧠 Approach
The following steps were performed in this task:

- Loaded the Bank Marketing dataset (`bank-full.csv`)
- Performed dataset inspection and preprocessing
- Categorical features were encoded using one-hot encoding
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression classification model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 📊 Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 89.85 on the test dataset.

## 📥 Files Included

- `README.md` — This project overview file

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Upload the dataset file (`bank-full.csv`)
3. Run all cells from top to bottom
4. View model performance and conclusions

## 🧾 Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the **Bank Marketing dataset**, which contains demographic and marketing information of customers along with a target column `y` indicating whether a customer accepted the offer (`yes`) or not (`no`).
